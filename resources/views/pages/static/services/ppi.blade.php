                <p class="about_text">
                    Payment Protection Insurance, or sometimes called 'loan protection' is an added charge on your monthly payments. It can be applied to Credit Cards, Loans and Mortgages and can also be purchased as a separate 'stand alone' policy.

                        <div style="display:block;">
                            <p>Most payment protection insurances were sold by sales people not financial advisors. As such these staff were very heavily pressured to sell as many PPI policies as possible. Unfortunately this meant that many sales people bent the truth and as such consumers were left paying for a miss-sold policy that did not suite their circumstances.</p>

                        <div>
                            <p>The financial regulator started fining companies for miss-sold PPI policies back in 2006. However PPI could have been miss-sold much earlier than that, in some cases as early as 1990. It wasn't until 2011 that companies started to take more care when selling PPI and the number of miss-sold policies was drastically reduced. We are able to investigate miss-selling of your PPI no matter when it was taken out, however if it was active on your loan in the last 6 years the process can be much faster.</p>

The process will normally take around 8 weeks, however depending on your specific case this could take a bit longer. We will keep you fully up to date at all stages of your claim.</p>
